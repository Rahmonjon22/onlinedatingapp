Lets build online dating app

I changed in package.json file in scripts from test => to start and in text from echo / error => node server.js 
so that i can use nodemon instead of node in order to watch it coninously
now i can write npm start  

npm install --save-dev nodemon => i have installed this one because we have access for npm package
now i can just write nodemon and hit enter and it restart any time plus watching the proccess
